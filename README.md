Tanto Cuore Town Randomizer
===========================

This is a Perl CGI application for randomizing the initial setup for
the card game Tanto Cuore.

The script uses a single table in a MySQL database to store all of the
card information.

MySQL configuration options are contained in the file config.yaml

A sample config file (config.yaml.SAMPLE) is included as a template.
Make sure browser access to your config file is denied by your web
server configuration!

The database structure and contents is in sql/cardlist.sql.
